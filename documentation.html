            <p>One obvious thing we might want to do with a company’s financial statements is to compare them to those of other, similar companies. But, It’s almost impossible to directly compare the financial statements for two companies because of differences in size.<br> To start making comparisons, one obvious thing we might try to do is to somehow standardize the financial statements. One common and useful way of doing this is to work with percentages instead of total dollars.</p>
            <p>Financial ratios are ways of comparing and investigating the relationships between different pieces of financial information. Financial ratios are traditionally grouped into the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Liquidity ratios</li>
              <li>Leverage ratios</li>
              <li>Efficiency ratios</li>
              <li>Profitability ratios</li>
              <li>Market value ratios</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Liquidity_ratios">
          <header>Liquidity ratios</header>
          <p>The primary concern is the firm’s ability to pay its bills over the short run without undue stress. Consequently, these ratios focus on current assets and current liabilities.<br> Financial managers are constantly working with banks and other short-term lenders and Liquidity ratios are particularly interesting to short-term creditors.</p>
          <p>One of the best-known and most widely used ratios is the current ratio
          <code>CURRENT RATIO = CURRENT ASSETS / CURRENT LIABILITIES</code></p>
          <p>Inventory is often the least liquid current asset. Also, relatively large inventories are often a sign of short-term trouble. Because of that, you can use Quick (Acid-Test) ratio
          <code>Quick ratio = (CURRENT ASSETS - INVENTORY) / CURRENT LIABILITIES</code></p>
          <p>If you are a very short-term creditor, you might be interested in Cash ratio
          <code>CASH RATIO = CASH / CURRENT LIABILITIES</code></p>
        </section>
            
        <section class="main-section" id="Leverage_ratios">
          <header>Leverage ratios</header>
          <p>Leverage ratios measure the amount of capital that comes from debt. In other words, leverage ratios are used to evaluate a company’s debt levels.</p>
          <p>The Debt ratio measures the relative amount of a company’s assets that are provided from debt
          <code>DEBT RATIO = TOTAL LIABILITIES / TOTAL ASSETS</code></p>
          <p>We can define two useful variations on the total debt ratio, the Debt-Equity ratio and the Equity Multiplier
          <code>DEBT-EQUITY RATIO = TOTAL DEBT / TOTAL EQUITY
                EQUITY MULTIPLIER = TOTAL ASSETS / TOTAL EQUITY = (TOTAL EQUITY + TOTAL DEBT) / TOTAL EQUITY = 1 + DEBT-EQUITY RATIO</code></p>
          <p>Times Interest Earned ratio measures how well a company has its interest obligations covered
          <code>TIMES INTEREST EARNED RATIO = EBIT / INTEREST</code></p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization are noncash expenses, so you can use Cash Coverage ratio instead of Times Interest Earned ratio
          <code>CASH COVERAGE RATIO = (EBIT + (DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION)) / INTEREST</code></p>
        </section>
            
        <section class="main-section" id="Efficiency_ratios">
          <header>Efficiency ratios</header>
          <p>Efficiency ratios, also known as asset management or utilization ratios, are used to measure how well a company is utilizing its assets and resources.</p>
          <p>Total asset turnover ratio shows "big picture" and measures a company’s ability to generate sales from it's assets
          <code>ASSET TURNOVER RATIO = TOTAL SALES / TOTAL ASSETS</code></p>
          <p>The inventory turnover ratio measures how many times a company’s inventory is sold and replaced over a given period
          <code>INVENTORY TURNOVER RATIO = COST OF GOODS SOLD / INVENTORY</code></p>
          <p>The Days Sales In Inventory ratio measures the average number of days that a company holds on to inventory before selling it to customers
          <code>DAYS' SALES IN INVENTORY RATIO = 365 DAYS / INVENTORY TURNOVER RATIO</code></p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Profitability_ratios">
          <header>Profitability ratios</header>
          <p>Profitability ratios assess a company's ability to earn profits from its sales or operations, balance sheet assets, or shareholders' equity</p>
          <p>Gross Profit Margin assess a company's financial health by calculating the amount of money left over from product sales after subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS)
          <code>GROSS PROFIT MARGIN = (NET SALES − COGS) / NET SALES</code></p>
          <p>Return On Assets (ROA) is a measure of profit per amount of assets
          <code>RETURN ON ASSETS = NET INCOME / TOTAL ASSETS</code></p>
          <p>Return On Equity (ROE) is a measure of how the stockholders fared during the year, because benefiting shareholders is our goal
          <code>RETURN ON EQUITY = NET INCOME / SHAREHOLDER’S EQUITY</code></p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Market_value_ratios">
          <header>Market value ratios</header>
          <p>Market value ratios help evaluate the economic status of publicly traded companies and can play a role in identifying stocks that may be overvalued, undervalued, or priced fairly.</p>
          <p>Earnings Per Share (EPS) ratio measures how much income have been earned by each share of common stock during a certain time period
          <code>EARNINGS PER SHARE = NET INCOME / TOTAL SHARES OUTSTANDING</code></p>
          <p>The Price-Earnings ratio compares a company’s share price to its earnings per share
          <code>PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO = PRICE PER SHARE / EARNINGS PER SHARE</code></p>
